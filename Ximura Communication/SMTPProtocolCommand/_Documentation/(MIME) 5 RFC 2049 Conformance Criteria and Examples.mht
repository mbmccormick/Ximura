<P>STD 11, <A href=3D"http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC =

</P></LI></OL>
<P>These documents are based on earlier work documented in <A=20
href=3D"http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc934.txt">RFC 934</A>, STD 11, and =
<A=20
href=3D"http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1049.txt">RFC 1049</A>, but =
extends and=20
revises them. Because <A =
href=3D"http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC=20
822</A> said so little about message bodies, these documents are largely =

orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) <A=20
href=3D"http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC 822</A>. </P>
<P>The initial document in this set, <A=20
href=3D"http://www.nacs.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MIME/2045/rfc2045.html">RFC =
2045</A>,=20
specifies the various headers used to describe the structure of MIME =
messages.=20
The second document defines the general structure of the MIME media =

system and defines an initial set of media types. The third document, <A =

href=3D"http://www.nacs.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MIME/2047/rfc2047.html">RFC =
2047</A>,=20
describes extensions to <A =

The=20

href=3D"http://www.nacs.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MIME/2048/rfc2048.html">RFC =
2048</A>,=20
specifies various IANA registration procedures for MIME-related =
facilities. This=20
fifth and final document describes MIME conformance criteria as well as=20
providing some illustrative examples of MIME message formats, =
acknowledgements,=20
and the bibliography. </P>
<P>These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521, 1522, and 1590, which =
themselves=20
were revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342. Appendix B of this document =
describes=20
differences and changes from previous versions. </P>
<H2><A name=3D1>1. Introduction </A></H2>
<P>The first and second documents in this set define MIME header fields =
and the=20
initial set of MIME media types. The third document describes extensions =
to=20
RFC822 formats to allow for character sets other than US-ASCII. This =
document=20
describes what portions of MIME must be supported by a conformant MIME=20
implementation. It also describes various pitfalls of contemporary =
messaging=20
systems as well as the canonical encoding model MIME is based on. </P>
<H2><A name=3D2>2. MIME Conformance </A></H2>
<P>The mechanisms described in these documents are open-ended. It is =
definitely=20
not expected that all implementations will support all available media =
types,=20
nor that they will all share the same extensions. In order to promote=20
interoperability, however, it is useful to define the concept of=20
"MIME-conformance" to define a certain level of implementation that =
allows the=20
useful interworking of messages with content that differs from US-ASCII =
text. In=20
this section, we specify the requirements for such conformance. </P>
<P>A mail user agent that is MIME-conformant MUST: </P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <P>Always generate a "MIME-Version: 1.0" header field in any message =
it=20
  creates. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Recognize the Content-Transfer-Encoding header field and decode all =

  received data encoded by either quoted-printable or base64 =
implementations.=20
  The identity transformations 7bit, 8bit, and binary must also be =
recognized.=20
  </P>
  <P>Any non-7bit data that is sent without encoding must be properly =
labelled=20
  with a content-transfer-encoding of 8bit or binary, as appropriate. If =
the=20
  underlying transport does not support 8bit or binary (as SMTP [<A=20
  href=3D"http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc821.txt">RFC-821</A>] does not), =
the=20
  sender is required to both encode and label data using an appropriate=20
  Content-Transfer-Encoding such as quoted-printable or base64. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Must treat any unrecognized Content-Transfer-Encoding as if it had =
a=20
  Content-Type of "application/octet-stream", regardless of whether or =
not the=20
  actual Content-Type is recognized. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Recognize and interpret the Content-Type header field, and avoid =
showing=20
  users raw data with a Content-Type field other than text. =
Implementations must=20
  be able to send at least text/plain messages, with the character set =
specified=20
  with the charset parameter if it is not US-ASCII. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Ignore any content type parameters whose names they do not =
recognize. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Explicitly handle the following media type values, to at least the=20
  following extents: </P>
  <P>Text: </P>
  <UL>
    <LI>
    <P>Recognize and display "text" mail with the character set =
"US-ASCII." </P>
    <LI>
    <P>Recognize other character sets at least to the extent of being =
able to=20
    inform the user about what character set the message uses. </P>
    <LI>
    <P>Recognize the "ISO-8859-*" character sets to the extent of being =
able to=20
    display those characters that are common to ISO-8859-* and US-ASCII, =
namely=20
    all characters represented by octet values 1-127. </P>
    <LI>
    <P>For unrecognized subtypes in a known character set, show or offer =
to show=20
    the user the "raw" version of the data after conversion of the =
content from=20
    canonical form to local form. </P>
    <LI>
    <P>Treat material in an unknown character set as if it were=20
    "application/octet-stream". </P></LI></UL>
  <P>Image, audio, and video: </P>
  <UL>
    <LI>
    <P>At a minumum provide facilities to treat any unrecognized =
subtypes as if=20
    they were "application/octet-stream". </P></LI></UL>
  <P>Application: </P>
  <UL>
    <LI>
    <P>Offer the ability to remove either of the quoted-printable or =
base64=20
    encodings defined in this document if they were used and put the =
resulting=20
    information in a user file. </P></LI></UL>
  <P>Multipart: </P>
  <UL>
    <LI>
    <P>Recognize the mixed subtype. Display all relevant information on =
the=20
    message level and the body part header level and then display or =
offer to=20
    display each of the body parts individually. </P>
    <LI>
    <P>Recognize the "alternative" subtype, and avoid showing the user =
redundant=20
    parts of multipart/alternative mail. </P>
    <LI>
    <P>Recognize the "multipart/digest" subtype, specifically using=20
    "message/rfc822" rather than "text/plain" as the default media type =
for body=20
    parts inside "multipart/digest" entities. </P>
    <LI>
    <P>Treat any unrecognized subtypes as if they were "mixed". =
</P></LI></UL>
  <P>Message: </P>
  <UL>
    <LI>
    <P>Recognize and display at least the RFC822 message encapsulation=20
    (message/rfc822) in such a way as to preserve any recursive =
structure, that=20
    is, displaying or offering to display the encapsulated data in =
accordance=20
    with its media type. </P>
    <LI>
    <P>Treat any unrecognized subtypes as if they were=20
    "application/octet-stream". </P></LI></UL>
  <LI>
  <P>Upon encountering any unrecognized Content-Type field, an =
implementation=20
  must treat it as if it had a media type of "application/octet-stream" =
with no=20
  parameter sub-arguments. How such data are handled is up to an =
implementation,=20
  but likely options for handling such unrecognized data include =
offering the=20
  user to write it into a file (decoded from its mail transport format) =
or=20
  offering the user to name a program to which the decoded data should =
be passed=20
  as input. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Conformant user agents are required, if they provide non-standard =
support=20
  for non-MIME messages employing character sets other than US-ASCII, to =
do so=20
  on received messages only. Conforming user agents must not send =
non-MIME=20
  messages containing anything other than US-ASCII text. </P>
  <P>In particular, the use of non-US-ASCII text in mail messages =
without a=20
  MIME-Version field is strongly discouraged as it impedes =
interoperability when=20
  sending messages between regions with different localization =
conventions.=20
  Conforming user agents MUST include proper MIME labelling when sending =

  anything other than plain text in the US-ASCII character set. </P>
  <P>In addition, non-MIME user agents should be upgraded if at all =
possible to=20
  include appropriate MIME header information in the messages they send =
even if=20
  nothing else in MIME is supported. This upgrade will have little, if =
any,=20
  effect on non-MIME recipients and will aid MIME in correctly =
displaying such=20
  messages. It also provides a smooth transition path to eventual =
adoption of=20
  other MIME capabilities. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Conforming user agents must ensure that any string of =
non-white-space=20
  printable US-ASCII characters within a "*text" or "*ctext" that begins =
with=20
  "=3D?" and ends with "?=3D" be a valid encoded-word. ("begins" means: =
At the start=20
  of the field-body or immediately following linear-white-space; "ends" =
means:=20
  At the end of the field-body or immediately preceding =
linear-white-space.) In=20
  addition, any "word" within a "phrase" that begins with "=3D?" and =
ends with=20
  "?=3D" must be a valid encoded-word. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Conforming user agents must be able to distinguish encoded-words =
from=20
  "text", "ctext", or "word"s, according to the rules in section 4, =
anytime they=20
  appear in appropriate places in message headers. It must support both =
the "B"=20
  and "Q" encodings for any character set which it supports. The program =
must be=20
  able to display the unencoded text if the character set is "US-ASCII". =
For the=20
  ISO-8859-* character sets, the mail reading program must at least be =
able to=20
  display the characters which are also in the US-ASCII set. =
</P></LI></OL>
<P>A user agent that meets the above conditions is said to be =
MIME-conformant.=20
The meaning of this phrase is that it is assumed to be "safe" to send =
virtually=20
any kind of properly-marked data to users of such mail systems, because =
such=20
systems will at least be able to treat the data as undifferentiated =
binary, and=20
will not simply splash it onto the screen of unsuspecting users. </P>
<P>There is another sense in which it is always "safe" to send data in a =
format=20
that is MIME-conformant, which is that such data will not break or be =
broken by=20
any known systems that are conformant with RFC 821 and <A=20
href=3D"http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC 822</A>. User agents =
that are=20
MIME-conformant have the additional guarantee that the user will not be =
shown=20
data that were never intended to be viewed as text. </P>
<H2><A name=3D3>3. Guidelines for Sending Email Data </A></H2>
<P>Internet email is not a perfect, homogeneous system. Mail may become=20
corrupted at several stages in its travel to a final destination. =
Specifically,=20
email sent throughout the Internet may travel across many networking=20
technologies. Many networking and mail technologies do not support the =
full=20
functionality possible in the SMTP transport environment. Mail =
traversing these=20
systems is likely to be modified in order that it can be transported. =
</P>
<P>There exist many widely-deployed non-conformant MTAs in the Internet. =
These=20
MTAs, speaking the SMTP protocol, alter messages on the fly to take =
advantage of=20
the internal data structure of the hosts they are implemented on, or are =
just=20
plain broken. </P>
<P>The following guidelines may be useful to anyone devising a data =
format=20
(media type) that is supposed to survive the widest range of networking=20
technologies and known broken MTAs unscathed. Note that anything encoded =
in the=20
base64 encoding will satisfy these rules, but that some well-known =
mechanisms,=20
notably the UNIX uuencode facility, will not. Note also that anything =
encoded in=20
the Quoted-Printable encoding will survive most gateways intact, but =
possibly=20
not some gateways to systems that use the EBCDIC character set. </P>
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <P>Under some circumstances the encoding used for data may change as =
part of=20
  normal gateway or user agent operation. In particular, conversion from =
base64=20
  to quoted-printable and vice versa may be necessary. This may result =
in the=20
  confusion of CRLF sequences with line breaks in text bodies. As such, =
the=20
  persistence of CRLF as something other than a line break must not be =
relied=20
  on. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Many systems may elect to represent and store text data using local =
newline=20
  conventions. Local newline conventions may not match the RFC822 CRLF=20
  convention -- systems are known that use plain CR, plain LF, CRLF, or =
counted=20
  records. The result is that isolated CR and LF characters are not well =

  tolerated in general; they may be lost or converted to delimiters on =
some=20
  systems, and hence must not be relied on. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The transmission of NULs (US-ASCII value 0) is problematic in =
Internet=20
  mail. (This is largely the result of NULs being used as a termination=20
  character by many of the standard runtime library routines in the C=20
  programming language.) The practice of using NULs as termination =
characters is=20
  so entrenched now that messages should not rely on them being =
preserved. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>TAB (HT) characters may be misinterpreted or may be automatically =
converted=20
  to variable numbers of spaces. This is unavoidable in some =
environments,=20
  notably those not based on the US-ASCII character set. Such conversion =
is=20
  STRONGLY DISCOURAGED, but it may occur, and mail formats must not rely =
on the=20
  persistence of TAB (HT) characters. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Lines longer than 76 characters may be wrapped or truncated in some =

  environments. Line wrapping or line truncation imposed by mail =
transports is=20
  STRONGLY DISCOURAGED, but unavoidable in some cases. Applications =
which=20
  require long lines must somehow differentiate between soft and hard =
line=20
  breaks. (A simple way to do this is to use the quoted-printable =
encoding.)=20
</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Trailing "white space" characters (SPACE, TAB (HT)) on a line may =
be=20
  discarded by some transport agents, while other transport agents may =
pad lines=20
  with these characters so that all lines in a mail file are of equal =
length.=20
  The persistence of trailing white space, therefore, must not be relied =
on.=20
</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Many mail domains use variations on the US-ASCII character set, or =
use=20
  character sets such as EBCDIC which contain most but not all of the =
US-ASCII=20
  characters. The correct translation of characters not in the =
"invariant" set=20
  cannot be depended on across character converting gateways. For =
example, this=20
  situation is a problem when sending uuencoded information across =
BITNET, an=20
  EBCDIC system. Similar problems can occur without crossing a gateway, =
since=20
  many Internet hosts use character sets other than US-ASCII internally. =
The=20
  definition of Printable Strings in X.400 adds further restrictions in =
certain=20
  special cases. In particular, the only characters that are known to be =

  consistent across all gateways are the 73 characters that correspond =
to the=20
  upper and lower case letters A-Z and a-z, the 10 digits 0-9, and the =
following=20
  eleven special characters: </P>

or a Sun=20
  raster image, or a VMS indexed file, or audio data in a =
system-dependent=20
  format stored only in memory, or anything else that corresponds to the =
local=20

attributes=20
  dictate the nature of the canonical form that is used. Conversion to =
the=20
  proper canonical form may involve character set conversion, =
transformation of=20
  audio data, compression, or various other operations specific to the =
various=20
  media types. If character set conversion is involved, however, care =
must be=20
  taken to understand the semantics of the media type, which may have =
strong=20
  implications for any character set conversion, e.g. with regard to=20
  syntactically meaningful characters in a text subtype other than =
"plain". </P>
  <P>For example, in the case of text/plain data, the text must be =

  <LI>
  <P>In many cases the conversion to a canonical form prior to encoding =

  <P>The output of the encoders may have to pass through one or more =

  </P></LI></OL>
<P>Other implementation variations are conceivable as well. The vital =
aspect of=20
this discussion is that, in spite of any optimizations, collapsings of =
required=20
steps, or insertion of additional processing, the resulting messages =
must be=20
consistent with those produced by the model described here. For example, =
a=20
message with the following header fields: </P><PRE>    Content-type: =
text/foo; charset=3Dbar
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
</PRE>
<P>must be first represented in the text/foo form, then (if necessary)=20
represented in the "bar" character set, and finally transformed via the =
base64=20
algorithm into a mail-safe form. </P>
<P><STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: Some confusion has been caused by systems that =

represent messages in a format which uses local newline conventions =
which differ=20
from the RFC822 CRLF convention. It is important to note that these =
formats are=20
not canonical RFC822/MIME. These formats are instead *encodings* of =
RFC822,=20
where CRLF sequences in the canonical representation of the message are =
encoded=20
as the local newline convention. Note that formats which encode CRLF =
sequences=20
as, for example, LF are not capable of representing MIME messages =
containing=20
binary data which contains LF octets not part of CRLF line separation =

      ... Some text appears here ...

    [Note that the blank between the boundary and the start
     of the text in this part means no header fields were

     It could have been done with explicit typing as in the
     next part.]

    --unique-boundary-1
    Content-type: text/plain; charset=3DUS-ASCII

    This could have been part of the previous part, but
    illustrates explicit versus implicit typing of body
    parts.

<OL>
  <LI>
  <P>This document has been completely reformatted and split into =
multiple=20
  documents. This was done to improve the quality of the plain text =
version of=20
  this document, which is required to be the reference copy. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>BNF describing the overall structure of MIME object headers has =
been added.=20
  This is a documentation change only -- the underlying syntax has not =
changed=20
  in any way. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The specific BNF for the seven media types in MIME has been =
removed. This=20
  BNF was incorrect, incomplete, amd inconsistent with the =
type-indendependent=20
  BNF. And since the type-independent BNF already fully specifies the =
syntax of=20
  the various MIME headers, the type-specific BNF was, in the final =
analysis,=20
  completely unnecessary and caused more problems than it solved. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The more specific "US-ASCII" character set name has replaced the =
use of the=20
  informal term ASCII in many parts of these documents. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The informal concept of a primary subtype has been removed. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The term "object" was being used inconsistently. The definition of =
this=20
  term has been clarified, along with the related terms "body", "body =
part", and=20
  "entity", and usage has been corrected where appropriate. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The BNF for the multipart media type has been rearranged to make it =
clear=20
  that the CRLF preceeding the boundary marker is actually part of the =
marker=20
  itself rather than the preceeding body part. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The prose and BNF describing the multipart media type have been =
changed to=20
  make it clear that the body parts within a multipart object MUST NOT =
contain=20
  any lines beginning with the boundary parameter string. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>In the rules on reassembling "message/partial" MIME entities, =
"Subject" is=20
  added to the list of headers to take from the inner message, and the =
example=20
  is modified to clarify this point. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>"Message/partial" fragmenters are restricted to splitting MIME =
objects only=20
  at line boundaries. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>In the discussion of the application/postscript type, an additional =

  paragraph has been added warning about possible interoperability =
problems=20
  caused by embedding of binary data inside a PostScript MIME entity. =
</P>
  <LI>
  <P>Added a clarifying note to the basic syntax rules for the =
Content-Type=20
  header field to make it clear that the following two forms: </P><PRE>  =
 Content-type: text/plain; charset=3Dus-ascii (comment)

   Content-type: text/plain; charset=3D"us-ascii"
</PRE>are completely equivalent.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>
  <P>The following sentence has been removed from the discussion of the=20
  MIME-Version header: "However, conformant software is encouraged to =
check the=20
  version number and at least warn the user if an unrecognized =
MIME-version is=20
  encountered." </P>
  <LI>
  <P>A typo was fixed that said "application/external-body" instead of=20
  "message/external-body". </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The definition of a character set has been reorganized to make the=20
  requirements clearer. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The definition of the "image/gif" media type has been moved to a =
separate=20
  document. This change was made because of potential conflicts with =
IETF rules=20
  governing the standardization of patented technology. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The definitions of "7bit" and "8bit" have been tightened so that =
use of=20
  bare CR, LF can only be used as end-of-line sequences. The document =
also no=20
  longer requires that NUL characters be preserved, which brings MIME =
into=20
  alignment with real-world implementations. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The definition of canonical text in MIME has been tightened so that =
line=20
  breaks must be represented by a CRLF sequence. CR and LF characters =
are not=20
  allowed outside of this usage. The definition of quoted-printable =
encoding has=20
  been altered accordingly. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The definition of the quoted-printable encoding now includes a =
number of=20
  suggestions for how quoted-printable encoders might best handle =
improperly=20
  encoded material. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Prose was added to clarify the use of the "7bit", "8bit", and =
"binary"=20
  transfer-encodings on multipart or message entities encapsulating =
"8bit" or=20
  "binary" data. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>In the section on MIME Conformance, "multipart/digest" support was =
added to=20
  the list of requirements for minimal MIME conformance. Also, the =
requirement=20
  for "message/rfc822" support were strengthened to clarify the =
importance of=20
  recognizing recursive structure. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The various restrictions on subtypes of "message" are now specified =

  entirely on a subtype by subtype basis. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The definition of "message/rfc822" was changed to indicate that at =
least=20
  one of the "From", "Subject", or "Date" headers must be present. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The required handling of unrecognized subtypes as=20
  "application/octet-stream" has been made more explicit in both the =
type=20
  definitions sections and the conformance guidelines. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Examples using text/richtext were changed to text/enriched. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The BNF definition of subtype has been changed to make it clear =
that either=20
  an IANA registered subtype or a nonstandard "X-" subtype must be used =
in a=20
  Content-Type header field. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>MIME media types that are simply registered for use and those that =
are=20
  standardized by the IETF are now distinguished in the MIME BNF. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>All of the various MIME registration procedures have been =
extensively=20
  revised. IANA registration procedures for character sets have been =
moved to a=20
  separate document that is no included in this set of documents. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The use of escape and shift mechanisms in the US-ASCII and =
ISO-8859-X=20
  character sets these documents define have been clarified: Such =
mechanisms=20
  should never be used in conjunction with these character sets and =
their effect=20
  if they are used is undefined. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The definition of the AFS access-type for message/external-body has =
been=20
  removed. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>The handling of the combination of multipart/alternative and=20
  message/external-body is now specifically addressed. </P>

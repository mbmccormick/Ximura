  <DT>Status of this Memo
  <DD>
  <P>This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for =
the=20
  Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for =
improvements.=20
  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet Official Protocol =

  Standards" (<A=20
  href=3D"http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/stdlist.html#s1">STD =
1</A>)=20
  for the standardization state and status of this protocol. =
Distribution of=20
  this memo is unlimited.=20
  <P></P>
  <DT>ABSTRACT
  <DD>
  <P>This specification enumerates and describes Internet mail addresses =

  (mailbox name @ host reference) to be used when contacting personnel =
at an=20
  organization. Mailbox names are provided for both operations and =
business=20
  functions. Additional mailbox names and aliases are not prohibited, =
but=20
  organizations which support email exchanges with the Internet are =
encouraged=20
  to support AT LEAST each mailbox name for which the associated =
function exists=20
  within the organization.=20
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><A name=3Dsec-1>1</A> RATIONALE AND SCOPE</STRONG>
  <DD>
  <P>Various Internet documents have specified mailbox names to be used =
when=20
  reaching the operators of the new service; for example, [<A=20
  =
href=3D"http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc0822.html">RFC822</A=
> 6.3,=20
  C.6] requires the presence of a &lt;POSTMASTER@domain&gt; mailbox name =
on all=20
  hosts that have an SMTP server. Other protocols have defacto standards =
for=20
  well known mailbox names, such as &lt;USENET@domain&gt; for NNTP (see =
[<A=20
  =
href=3D"http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc0977.html">RFC977</A=
>]),=20
  and &lt;WEBMASTER@domain&gt; for HTTP (see [HTTP]). Defacto standards =
also=20
  exist for well known mailbox names which have nothing to do with a =
particular=20
  protocol, e.g., &lt;ABUSE@domain&gt; and <PRE>   =
&lt;TROUBLE@domain&gt;.
</PRE>
  <P>The purpose of this memo is to aggregate and specify the basic set =
of=20
  mailbox names which organizations need to support. Most =
<BR>organizations do=20
  not need to support the full set of mailbox names defined here, since =
not=20
  every organization will implement the all of the associated services. =
However,=20
  if a given service is offerred, then the associated mailbox name(es) =
must be=20
  supported, resulting in delivery to a recipient appropriate for the =
referenced=20
  service or role.=20
  <P></P>
  <DT>
  <HR>
  <EM><A name=3Dpage-2>Page 2</A></EM>
  <DD>
  <P>If a host is not configured to accept mail directly, but it =
implements a=20
  service for which this specification defines a mailbox name, that host =
must=20
  have an MX RR set (see [<A=20
  =
href=3D"http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc0974.html">RFC974</A=
>]) and=20
  the mail exchangers specified by this RR set must recognize the =
referenced=20
  host's domain name as "local" for the purpose of accepting mail bound =
for the=20
  defined mailbox name. Note that this is true even if the advertised =
domain=20
  name is not the same as the host's domain name; for example, if an =
NNTP=20
  server's host name is DATA.RAMONA.VIX.COM yet it advertises the domain =
name=20
  VIX.COM in its "Path:" headers, then mail must be deliverable to both=20
  &lt;USENET@VIX.COM&gt; and <PRE>   &lt;USENET@DATA.RAMONA.VIX.COM&gt;, =
even though these addresses might be
   delivered to different final destinations.
</PRE>
  <P>The scope of a well known mailbox name is its domain name. Servers=20
  accepting mail on behalf of a domain must accept and correctly process =
mailbox=20
  names for that domain, even if the server, itself, does not support =
the=20
  associated service. So, for example, if an NNTP server advertises the=20
  organization's top level domain in "Path:" headers (see [<A=20
  =
href=3D"http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc0977.html">RFC977</A=
>]) the=20
  mail exchangers for that top level domain must accept mail to=20
  &lt;USENET@domain&gt; even if the mail exchanger hosts do not, =
themselves,=20
  serve the NNTP protocol.=20
  <P></P>
  <DT><STRONG><A name=3Dsec-2>2</A> INVARIANTS</STRONG>
  <DD>
  <P>For well known names that are not related to specific protocols, =
only the=20
  organization's top level domain name are required to be valid. For =
example, if=20
  an Internet service provider's domain name is COMPANY.COM, then the=20
  &lt;ABUSE@COMPANY.COM&gt; address must be valid and supported, even =
though the=20
  customers whose activity generates complaints use hosts with more =
specific=20
  domain names like SHELL1.COMPANY.COM. Note, however, that it is valid =
and=20
  encouraged to support mailbox names for sub-domains, as appropriate.=20
  <P>Mailbox names must be recognized independent of character case. For =

  example, POSTMASTER, postmaster, Postmaster, PostMaster, and even =
PoStMaStEr=20
  are to be treated the same, with delivery to the same mailbox.=20
  <P>Implementations of these well known names need to take account of =
the=20
  expectations of the senders who will use them. Sending back an =
automatic mail=20
  acknowledgement is usually helpful (though we suggest caution against =
the=20
  possibility of "duelling mail robots" and the resulting mail loops).=20

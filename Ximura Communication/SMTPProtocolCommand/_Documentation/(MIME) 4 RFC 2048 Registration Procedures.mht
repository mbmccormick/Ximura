<P>STD 11, <A href=3D"http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC =

a message representation protocol specifying considerable detail about =

<P>These documents are based on earlier work documented in <A=20

<A=20

orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) <A=20

<P>Registration of character sets for use in MIME is covered elsewhere =

<P>These documents are revisions of RFCs 1521 and 1522, which themselves =
were=20
revisions of RFCs 1341 and 1342. An appendix in <A=20
href=3D"http://www.nacs.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MIME/2049/rfc2049.html">RFC =
2049</A>=20
describes differences and changes from previous versions. </P>
<H2><A name=3D1>1. Introduction </A></H2>
<P>Recent Internet protocols have been carefully designed to be easily=20
extensible in certain areas. In particular, MIME [<A=20
href=3D"http://www.nacs.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MIME/2045/rfc2045.html">RFC =
2045</A>]=20
is an open-ended framework and can accommodate additional object types,=20
character sets, and access methods without any changes to the basic =
protocol. A=20
registration process is needed, however, to ensure that the set of such =
values=20
is developed in an orderly, well-specified, and public manner. </P>
<P>This document defines registration procedures which use the Internet =
Assigned=20
Numbers Authority (IANA) as a central registry for such values. </P>
<P>Historical Note: The registration process for media types was =
initially=20
defined in the context of the asynchronous Internet mail environment. In =
this=20
mail environment there is a need to limit the number of possible media =
types to=20
increase the likelihood of interoperability when the capabilities of the =
remote=20
mail system are not known. As media types are used in new environments, =
where=20
the proliferation of media types is not a hindrance to interoperability, =
the=20
original procedure was excessively restrictive and had to be =
generalized. </P>
<H2><A name=3D2>2. Media Type Registration </A></H2>
<P>Registration of a new media type or types starts with the =
construction of a=20
registration proposal. Registration may occur in several different =
registration=20
trees, which have different requirements as discussed below. In general, =
the new=20
registration proposal is circulated and reviewed in a fashion =
appropriate to the=20
tree involved. The media type is then registered if the proposal is =
acceptable.=20
The following sections describe the requirements and procedures used for =
each of=20
the different registration trees. </P>
<H3><A name=3D2.1>2.1. Registration Trees and Subtype Names </A></H3>
<P>In order to increase the efficiency and flexibility of the =
registration=20
process, different structures of subtype names may be registered to =
accomodate=20
the different natural requirements for, e.g., a subtype that will be =
recommended=20
for wide support and implementation by the Internet Community or a =
subtype that=20
is used to move files associated with proprietary software. The =
following=20
subsections define registration "trees", distinguished by the use of =
faceted=20
names (e.g., names of the form "tree.subtree...type"). Note that some =
media=20
types defined prior to this document do not conform to the naming =
conventions=20
described below. See Appendix A for a discussion of them. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.1.1>2.1.1. IETF Tree </A></H4>
<P>The IETF tree is intended for types of general interest to the =
Internet=20
Community. Registration in the IETF tree requires approval by the IESG =
and=20
publication of the media type registration as some form of RFC. </P>
<P>Media types in the IETF tree are normally denoted by names that are =
not=20
explicitly faceted, i.e., do not contain period (".", full stop) =
characters.=20
</P>
<P>The "owner" of a media type registration in the IETF tree is assumed =
to be=20
the IETF itself. Modification or alteration of the specification =
requires the=20
same level of processing (e.g. standards track) required for the initial =

registration. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.1.2>2.1.2. Vendor Tree </A></H4>
<P>The vendor tree is used for media types associated with commercially=20
available products. "Vendor" or "producer" are construed as equivalent =
and very=20
broadly in this context. </P>
<P>A registration may be placed in the vendor tree by anyone who has =
need to=20
interchange files associated with the particular product. However, the=20
registration formally belongs to the vendor or organization producing =
the=20
software or file format. Changes to the specification will be made at =
their=20
request, as discussed in subsequent sections. </P>
<P>Registrations in the vendor tree will be distinguished by the leading =
facet=20
"vnd.". That may be followed, at the discretion of the registration, by =
either a=20
media type name from a well-known producer (e.g., "vnd.mudpie") or by an =

IANA-approved designation of the producer's name which is then followed =
by a=20
media type or product designation (e.g., vnd.bigcompany.funnypictures). =
</P>
<P>While public exposure and review of media types to be registered in =
the=20
vendor tree is not required, using the ietf-types list for review is =
strongly=20
encouraged to improve the quality of those specifications. Registrations =
in the=20
vendor tree may be submitted directly to the IANA. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.1.3>2.1.3. Personal or Vanity Tree </A></H4>
<P>Registrations for media types created experimentally or as part of =
products=20
that are not distributed commercially may be registered in the personal =
or=20
vanity tree. The registrations are distinguished by the leading facet =
"prs.".=20
</P>
<P>The owner of "personal" registrations and associated specifications =
is the=20
person or entity making the registration, or one to whom responsibility =
has been=20
transferred as described below. </P>
<P>While public exposure and review of media types to be registered in =
the=20
personal tree is not required, using the ietf-types list for review is =
strongly=20
encouraged to improve the quality of those specifications. Registrations =
in the=20
personl tree may be submitted directly to the IANA. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.1.4>2.1.4. Special `x.' Tree </A></H4>
<P>For convenience and symmetry with this registration scheme, media =
type names=20
with "x." as the first facet may be used for the same purposes for which =
names=20
starting in "x-" are normally used. These types are unregistered, =
experimental,=20
and should be used only with the active agreement of the parties =
exchanging=20
them. </P>
<P>However, with the simplified registration procedures described above =
for=20
vendor and personal trees, it should rarely, if ever, be necessary to =
use=20
unregistered experimental types, and as such use of both "x-" and "x." =
forms is=20
discouraged. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.1.5>2.1.5. Additional Registration Trees </A></H4>
<P>From time to time and as required by the community, the IANA may, =
with the=20
advice and consent of the IESG, create new top-level registration trees. =
It is=20
explicitly assumed that these trees may be created for external =
registration and=20
management by well-known permanent bodies, such as scientific societies =
for=20
media types specific to the sciences they cover. In general, the quality =
of=20
review of specifications for one of these additional registration trees =
is=20
expected to be equivalent to that which IETF would give to registrations =
in its=20
own tree. Establishment of these new trees will be announced through RFC =

publication approved by the IESG. </P>
<H3><A name=3D2.2>2.2. Registration Requirements </A></H3>
<P>Media type registration proposals are all expected to conform to =
various=20
requirements laid out in the following sections. Note that requirement =
specifics=20
sometimes vary depending on the registration tree, again as detailed in =
the=20
following sections. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.2.1>2.2.1. Functionality Requirement </A></H4>
<P>Media types must function as an actual media format: Registration of =
things=20
that are better thought of as a transfer encoding, as a character set, =
or as a=20
collection of separate entities of another type, is not allowed. For =
example,=20
although applications exist to decode the base64 transfer encoding [<A=20
href=3D"http://www.nacs.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MIME/2045/rfc2045.html">RFC =
2045</A>],=20
base64 cannot be registered as a media type. </P>
<P>This requirement applies regardless of the registration tree =
involved. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.2.2>2.2.2. Naming Requirements </A></H4>
<P>All registered media types must be assigned MIME type and subtype =
names. The=20
combination of these names then serves to uniquely identify the media =
type and=20
the format of the subtype name identifies the registration tree. </P>
<P>The choice of top-level type name must take the nature of media type =
involved=20
into account. For example, media normally used for representing still =
images=20
should be a subtype of the image content type, whereas media capable of=20
representing audio information belongs under the audio content type. See =
<A=20
href=3D"http://www.nacs.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MIME/2046/rfc2046.html">RFC =
2046</A>=20
for additional information on the basic set of top-level types and their =

characteristics. </P>
<P>New subtypes of top-level types must conform to the restrictions of =
the=20
top-level type, if any. For example, all subtypes of the multipart =
content type=20
must use the same encapsulation syntax. </P>
<P>In some cases a new media type may not "fit" under any currently =
defined=20
top-level content type. Such cases are expected to be quite rare. =
However, if=20
such a case arises a new top-level type can be defined to accommodate =
it. Such a=20
definition must be done via standards-track RFC; no other mechanism can =
be used=20
to define additional top-level content types. </P>
<P>These requirements apply regardless of the registration tree =
involved. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.2.3>2.2.3. Parameter Requirements </A></H4>
<P>Media types may elect to use one or more MIME content type =
parameters, or=20
some parameters may be automatically made available to the media type by =
virtue=20
of being a subtype of a content type that defines a set of parameters =
applicable=20
to any of its subtypes. In either case, the names, values, and meanings =
of any=20
parameters must be fully specified when a media type is registered in =
the IETF=20
tree, and should be specified as completely as possible when media types =
are=20
registered in the vendor or personal trees. </P>
<P>New parameters must not be defined as a way to introduce new =
functionality in=20
types registered in the IETF tree, although new parameters may be added =
to=20
convey additional information that does not otherwise change existing=20
functionality. An example of this would be a "revision" parameter to =
indicate a=20
revision level of an external specification such as JPEG. Similar =
behavior is=20
encouraged for media types registered in the vendor or personal trees =
but is not=20
required. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.2.4>2.2.4. Canonicalization and Format Requirements =
</A></H4>
<P>All registered media types must employ a single, canonical data =
format,=20
regardless of registration tree. </P>
<P>A precise and openly available specification of the format of each =
media type=20
is required for all types registered in the IETF tree and must at a =
minimum be=20
referenced by, if it isn't actually included in, the media type =
registration=20
proposal itself. </P>
<P>The specifications of format and processing particulars may or may =
not be=20
publically available for media types registered in the vendor tree, and =
such=20
registration proposals are explicitly permitted to include only a =
specification=20
of which software and version produce or process such media types. =
References to=20
or inclusion of format specifications in registration proposals is =
encouraged=20
but not required. </P>
<P>Format specifications are still required for registration in the =
personal=20
tree, but may be either published as RFCs or otherwise deposited with =
IANA. The=20
deposited specifications will meet the same criteria as those required =
to=20
register a well-known TCP port and, in particular, need not be made =
public. </P>
<P>Some media types involve the use of patented technology. The =
registration of=20
media types involving patented technology is specifically permitted. =
However,=20
the restrictions set forth in RFC 1602 on the use of patented technology =
in=20
standards-track protocols must be respected when the specification of a =
media=20
type is part of a standards-track protocol. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.2.5>2.2.5. Interchange Recommendations </A></H4>
<P>Media types should, whenever possible, interoperate across as many =
systems=20
and applications as possible. However, some media types will inevitably =
have=20
problems interoperating across different platforms. Problems with =
different=20
versions, byte ordering, and specifics of gateway handling can and will =
arise.=20
</P>
<P>Universal interoperability of media types is not required, but known=20
interoperability issues should be identified whenever possible. =
Publication of a=20
media type does not require an exhaustive review of interoperability, =
and the=20
interoperability considerations section is subject to continuing =
evaluation.=20
</P>
<P>These recommendations apply regardless of the registration tree =
involved.=20
</P>
<H4><A name=3D2.2.6>2.2.6. Security Requirements </A></H4>
<P>An analysis of security issues is required for for all types =
registered in=20
the IETF Tree. (This is in accordance with the basic requirements for =
all IETF=20
protocols.) A similar analysis for media types registered in the vendor =
or=20
personal trees is encouraged but not required. However, regardless of =
what=20
security analysis has or has not been done, all descriptions of security =
issues=20
must be as accurate as possible regardless of registration tree. In =
particular,=20
a statement that there are "no security issues associated with this =
type" must=20
not be confused with "the security issues associates with this type have =
not=20
been assessed". </P>
<P>There is absolutely no requirement that media types registered in any =
tree be=20
secure or completely free from risks. Nevertheless, all known security =
risks=20
must be identified in the registration of a media type, again regardless =
of=20
registration tree. </P>
<P>The security considerations section of all registrations is subject =
to=20
continuing evaluation and modification, and in particular may be =
extended by use=20
of the "comments on media types" mechanism described in subsequent =
sections.=20
</P>
<P>Some of the issues that should be looked at in a security analysis of =
a media=20
type are: </P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <P>Complex media types may include provisions for directives that =
institute=20
  actions on a recipient's files or other resources. In many cases =
provision is=20
  made for originators to specify arbitrary actions in an unrestricted =
fashion=20
  which may then have devastating effects. See the registration of the=20
  application/postscript media type in <A=20
  =
href=3D"http://www.nacs.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MIME/2046/rfc2046.html">RFC =
2046</A>=20
  for an example of such directives and how to handle them. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Complex media types may include provisions for directives that =
institute=20
  actions which, while not directly harmful to the recipient, may result =
in=20
  disclosure of information that either facilitates a subsequent attack =
or else=20
  violates a recipient's privacy in some way. Again, the registration of =
the=20
  application/postscript media type illustrates how such directives can =
be=20
  handled. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>A media type might be targeted for applications that require some =
sort of=20
  security assurance but not provide the necessary security mechanisms=20
  themselves. For example, a media type could be defined for storage of=20
  confidential medical information which in turn requires an external=20
  confidentiality service. </P></LI></OL>
<H4><A name=3D2.2.7>2.2.7. Usage and Implementation Non-requirements =
</A></H4>
<P>In the asynchronous mail environment, where information on the =
capabilities=20
of the remote mail agent is frequently not available to the sender, =
maximum=20
interoperability is attained by restricting the number of media types =
used to=20
those "common" formats expected to be widely implemented. This was =
asserted in=20
the past as a reason to limit the number of possible media types and =
resulted in=20
a registration process with a significant hurdle and delay for those =
registering=20
media types. </P>
<P>However, the need for "common" media types does not require limiting =
the=20
registration of new media types. If a limited set of media types is =
recommended=20
for a particular application, that should be asserted by a separate=20
applicability statement specific for the application and/or environment. =
</P>
<P>As such, universal support and implementation of a media type is NOT =
a=20
requirement for registration. If, however, a media type is explicitly =
intended=20
for limited use, this should be noted in its registration. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.2.8>2.2.8. Publication Requirements </A></H4>
<P>Proposals for media types registered in the IETF tree must be =
published as=20
RFCs. RFC publication of vendor and personal media type proposals is =
encouraged=20
but not required. In all cases IANA will retain copies of all media type =

proposals and "publish" them as part of the media types registration =
tree=20
itself. </P>
<P>Other than in the IETF tree, the registration of a data type does not =
imply=20
endorsement, approval, or recommendation by IANA or IETF or even =
certification=20
that the specification is adequate. To become Internet Standards, =
protocol, data=20
objects, or whatever must go through the IETF standards process. This is =
too=20
difficult and too lengthy a process for the convenient registration of =
media=20
types. </P>
<P>The IETF tree exists for media types that do require require a =
substantive=20
review and approval process with the vendor and personal trees exist for =
those=20
that do not. It is expected that applicability statements for particular =

applications will be published from time to time that recommend =
implementation=20
of, and support for, media types that have proven particularly useful in =
those=20
contexts. </P>
<P>As discussed above, registration of a top-level type requires =
standards-track=20
processing and, hence, RFC publication. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.2.9>2.2.9. Additional Information </A></H4>
<P>Various sorts of optional information may be included in the =
specification of=20
a media type if it is available: </P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <P>Magic number(s) (length, octet values). Magic numbers are byte =
sequences=20
  that are always present and thus can be used to identify entities as =
being of=20
  a given media type. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>File extension(s) commonly used on one or more platforms to =
indicate that=20
  some file containing a given type of media. </P>
  <LI>
  <P>Macintosh File Type code(s) (4 octets) used to label files =
containing a=20
  given type of media. </P></LI></OL>
<P>Such information is often quite useful to implementors and if =
available=20
should be provided. </P>
<H3><A name=3D2.3>2.3. Registration Procedure </A></H3>
<P>The following procedure has been implemented by the IANA for review =
and=20
approval of new media types. This is not a formal standards process, but =
rather=20
an administrative procedure intended to allow community comment and =
sanity=20
checking without excessive time delay. For registration in the IETF =
tree, the=20
normal IETF processes should be followed, treating posting of an =
internet-draft=20
and announcement on the ietf-types list (as described in the next =
subsection) as=20
a first step. For registrations in the vendor or personal tree, the =
initial=20
review step described below may be omitted and the type registered =
directly by=20
submitting the template and an explanation directly to IANA (at =
iana@iana.org).=20
However, authors of vendor or personal media type specifications are =
encouraged=20
to seek community review and comment whenever that is feasible. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.3.1>2.3.1. Present the Media Type to the Community for =
Review=20
</A></H4>
<P>Send a proposed media type registration to the "ietf-types@iana.org" =
mailing=20
list for a two week review period. This mailing list has been =
established for=20
the purpose of reviewing proposed media and access types. Proposed media =
types=20
are not formally registered and must not be used; the "x-" prefix =
specified in=20
<A =
href=3D"http://www.nacs.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MIME/2045/rfc2045.html">RFC=20
2045</A> can be used until registration is complete. </P>
<P>The intent of the public posting is to solicit comments and feedback =
on the=20
choice of type/subtype name, the unambiguity of the references with =
respect to=20
versions and external profiling information, and a review of any=20
interoperability or security considerations. The submitter may submit a =
revised=20
registration, or withdraw the registration completely, at any time. </P>
<H4><A name=3D2.3.2>2.3.2. IESG Approval </A></H4>
<P>Media types registered in the IETF tree must be submitted to the IESG =

</P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <P>Media types must function as an actual media format. In particular, =

  character sets and transfer encodings may not be registered as media =

  </P>
  <LI>
  <P>All media types must have properly formed type and subtype names. =
All type=20

be=20
  unique, must conform to the MIME grammar for such names, and must =
contain the=20

several purposes: </P>
<OL>
  <LI>
  <P>Many transports, especially message transports, can only handle =

  restrictions on what characters can be used in these lines of text -- =
some=20
  transports are restricted to a small subset of US-ASCII and others =
cannot=20
  handle certain character sequences. Transfer encodings are used to =
transform=20
  binary data into textual form that can survive such transports. =
Examples of=20
  this sort of transfer encoding include the base64 and quoted-printable =

  transfer encodings defined in <A=20
  =

  <LI>
  <P>Image, audio, video, and even application entities are sometimes =

transfer=20

7bit and 8bit. </P>
<H4><A name=3D4.1.4>4.1.4. Output Range Requirements </A></H4>
<P>There is no requirement that a particular tranfer encoding produce a=20
particular form of encoded output. However, the output format for each =
transfer=20
encoding must be fully and completely documented. In particular, each=20
specification must clearly state whether the output format always lies =

</P>
<H4><A name=3D4.1.5>4.1.5. Data Integrity and Generality Requirements =

<P>All transfer encodings must be fully invertible on any platform; it =

Hi, these are the raw files I used for producing a number of code project articles for using the collection classes. 

I have placed them here in the project so I can find them, when needed, and also they provide a handy guide on how to use the classes for my own reference. 

Please note, these files are currently encrypted as I am still writing them.

Thanks,

Paul Stancer.

Fielding, et=20
al.</ADDRESS>
<H2><A id=3Dsec10>10</A> Status Code Definitions</H2>
<P>Each Status-Code is described below, including a description of which =

method(s) it can follow and any metainformation required in the =
response. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.1>10.1</A> Informational 1xx</H3>
<P>This class of status code indicates a provisional response, =
consisting only=20
of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty =
line.=20
There are no required headers for this class of status code. Since =
HTTP/1.0 did=20
not define any 1xx status codes, servers MUST NOT send a 1xx response to =
an=20
HTTP/1.0 client except under experimental conditions. </P>
<P>A client MUST be prepared to accept one or more 1xx status responses =
prior to=20
a regular response, even if the client does not expect a 100 (Continue) =
status=20
message. Unexpected 1xx status responses MAY be ignored by a user agent. =
</P>
<P>Proxies MUST forward 1xx responses, unless the connection between the =
proxy=20
and its client has been closed, or unless the proxy itself requested the =

generation of the 1xx response. (For example, if a </P>
<P>proxy adds a "Expect: 100-continue" field when it forwards a request, =
then it=20
need not forward the corresponding 100 (Continue) response(s).) </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.1.1>10.1.1</A> 100 Continue</H3>
<P>The client SHOULD continue with its request. This interim response is =
used to=20
inform the client that the initial part of the request has been received =
and has=20
not yet been rejected by the server. The client SHOULD continue by =
sending the=20
remainder of the request or, if the request has already been completed, =
ignore=20
this response. The server MUST send a final response after the request =
has been=20
completed. See section <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html#sec8.2.3"=20
rel=3Dxref>8.2.3</A> for detailed discussion of the use and handling of =
this=20
status code. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.1.2>10.1.2</A> 101 Switching Protocols</H3>
<P>The server understands and is willing to comply with the client's =
request,=20
via the Upgrade message header field (section 14.42), for a change in =
the=20
application protocol being used on this connection. The server will =
switch=20
protocols to those defined by the response's Upgrade header field =
immediately=20
after the empty line which terminates the 101 response. </P>
<P>The protocol SHOULD be switched only when it is advantageous to do =
so. For=20
example, switching to a newer version of HTTP is advantageous over older =

versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous protocol might be=20
advantageous when delivering resources that use such features. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.2>10.2</A> Successful 2xx</H3>
<P>This class of status code indicates that the client's request was=20
successfully received, understood, and accepted. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.2.1>10.2.1</A> 200 OK</H3>
<P>The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response =
is=20
dependent on the method used in the request, for example: </P>
<P>GET an entity corresponding to the requested resource is sent in the=20
response; </P>
<P>HEAD the entity-header fields corresponding to the requested resource =
are=20
sent in the response without any message-body; </P>
<P>POST an entity describing or containing the result of the action; =
</P>
<P>TRACE an entity containing the request message as received by the end =
server.=20
</P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.2.2>10.2.2</A> 201 Created</H3>
<P>The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being =
created.=20
The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s) returned in =
the=20
entity of the response, with the most specific URI for the resource =
given by a=20
Location header field. The response SHOULD include an entity containing =
a list=20
of resource characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user =
agent=20
can choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by =
the media=20
type given in the Content-Type header field. The origin server MUST =
create the=20
resource before returning the 201 status code. If the action cannot be =
carried=20
out immediately, the server SHOULD respond with 202 (Accepted) response =
instead.=20
</P>
<P>A 201 response MAY contain an ETag response header field indicating =
the=20
current value of the entity tag for the requested variant just created, =
see=20
section <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.19" =

rel=3Dxref>14.19</A>. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.2.3>10.2.3</A> 202 Accepted</H3>
<P>The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has =
not been=20
completed. The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as =
it might=20
be disallowed when processing actually takes place. There is no facility =
for=20
re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation such as this. =
</P>
<P>The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. Its purpose is to =
allow a=20
server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a =
batch-oriented=20
process that is only run once per day) without requiring that the user =
agent's=20
connection to the server persist until the process is completed. The =
entity=20
returned with this response SHOULD include an indication of the =
request's=20
current status and either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate =
of when=20
the user can expect the request to be fulfilled. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.2.4>10.2.4</A> 203 Non-Authoritative Information</H3>
<P>The returned metainformation in the entity-header is not the =
definitive set=20
as available from the origin server, but is gathered from a local or a=20
third-party copy. The set presented MAY be a subset or superset of the =
original=20
version. For example, including local annotation information about the =
resource=20
might result in a superset of the metainformation known by the origin =
server.=20
Use of this response code is not required and is only appropriate when =
the=20
response would otherwise be 200 (OK). </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.2.5>10.2.5</A> 204 No Content</H3>
<P>The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an=20
entity-body, and might want to return updated metainformation. The =
response MAY=20
include new or updated metainformation in the form of entity-headers, =
which if=20
present SHOULD be associated with the requested variant. </P>
<P>If the client is a user agent, it SHOULD NOT change its document view =
from=20
that which caused the request to be sent. This response is primarily =
intended to=20
allow input for actions to take place without causing a change to the =
user=20
agent's active document view, although any new or updated =
metainformation SHOULD=20
be applied to the document currently in the user agent's active view. =
</P>
<P>The 204 response MUST NOT include a message-body, and thus is always=20
terminated by the first empty line after the header fields. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.2.6>10.2.6</A> 205 Reset Content</H3>
<P>The server has fulfilled the request and the user agent SHOULD reset =
the=20
document view which caused the request to be sent. This response is =
primarily=20
intended to allow input for actions to take place via user input, =
followed by a=20
clearing of the form in which the input is given so that the user can =
easily=20
initiate another input action. The response MUST NOT include an entity. =
</P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.2.7>10.2.7</A> 206 Partial Content</H3>
<P>The server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource. =
The=20
request MUST have included a Range header field (section 14.35) =
indicating the=20
desired range, and MAY have included an If-Range header field (section =
<A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.27" =

rel=3Dxref>14.27</A>) to make the request conditional. </P>
<P>The response MUST include the following header fields: </P><PRE>      =
- Either a Content-Range header field (section 14.16) indicating
        the range included with this response, or a multipart/byteranges
        Content-Type including Content-Range fields for each part. If a
        Content-Length header field is present in the response, its
        value MUST match the actual number of OCTETs transmitted in the
        message-body.
</PRE><PRE>      - Date
</PRE><PRE>      - ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would =
have been sent
        in a 200 response to the same request
</PRE><PRE>      - Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the =
field-value might
        differ from that sent in any previous response for the same
        variant
</PRE>
<P>If the 206 response is the result of an If-Range request that used a =
strong=20
cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include =
other=20
entity-headers. If the response is the result of an If-Range request =
that used a=20
weak validator, the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this =

prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated =
headers.=20
Otherwise, the response MUST include all of the entity-headers that =
would have=20
been returned with a 200 (OK) response to the same request. </P>
<P>A cache MUST NOT combine a 206 response with other previously cached =
content=20
if the ETag or Last-Modified headers do not match exactly, see <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html#sec13.5.4"=
=20
rel=3Dxref>13.5.4</A>. </P>
<P>A cache that does not support the Range and Content-Range headers =
MUST NOT=20
cache 206 (Partial) responses. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.3>10.3</A> Redirection 3xx</H3>
<P>This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be =
taken by=20
the user agent in order to fulfill the request. The action required MAY =
be=20
carried out by the user agent without interaction with the user if and =
only if=20
the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. A client SHOULD =
detect=20
infinite redirection loops, since such loops generate network traffic =
for each=20
redirection. </P><PRE>      Note: previous versions of this =
specification recommended a
      maximum of five redirections. Content developers should be aware
      that there might be clients that implement such a fixed
      limitation.
</PRE>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.3.1>10.3.1</A> 300 Multiple Choices</H3>
<P>The requested resource corresponds to any one of a set of =
representations,=20
each with its own specific location, and agent- driven negotiation =
information=20
(section 12) is being provided so that the user (or user agent) can =
select a=20
preferred representation and redirect its request to that location. </P>
<P>Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity=20
containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) from which =
the=20
user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity =
format is=20
specified by the media type given in the Content- Type header field. =
Depending=20
upon the format and the capabilities of </P>
<P>the user agent, selection of the most appropriate choice MAY be =
performed=20
automatically. However, this specification does not define any standard =
for such=20
automatic selection. </P>
<P>If the server has a preferred choice of representation, it SHOULD =
include the=20
specific URI for that representation in the Location field; user agents =
MAY use=20
the Location field value for automatic redirection. This response is =
cacheable=20
unless indicated otherwise. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.3.2>10.3.2</A> 301 Moved Permanently</H3>
<P>The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any =
future=20
references to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned URIs. Clients =
with=20
link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link references to =
the=20
Request-URI to one or more of the new references returned by the server, =
where=20
possible. This response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise. </P>
<P>The new permanent URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the =
response.=20
Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD =
contain a=20
short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s). </P>
<P>If the 301 status code is received in response to a request other =
than GET or=20
HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless =
it can=20
be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under =
which the=20
request was issued. </P><PRE>      Note: When automatically redirecting =
a POST request after
      receiving a 301 status code, some existing HTTP/1.0 user agents
      will erroneously change it into a GET request.
</PRE>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.3.3>10.3.3</A> 302 Found</H3>
<P>The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. =
Since the=20
redirection might be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to =
use the=20
Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if =
indicated by=20
a Cache-Control or Expires header field. </P>
<P>The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the =
response.=20
Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD =
contain a=20
short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s). </P>
<P>If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other =
than GET or=20
HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless =
it can=20
be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under =
which the=20
request was issued. </P><PRE>      Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify =
that the client is not allowed
      to change the method on the redirected request.  However, most
      existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303
      response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless
      of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have
      been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which
      kind of reaction is expected of the client.
</PRE>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.3.4>10.3.4</A> 303 See Other</H3>
<P>The response to the request can be found under a different URI and =
SHOULD be=20
retrieved using a GET method on that resource. This method exists =
primarily to=20
allow the output of a POST-activated script to redirect the user agent =
to a=20
selected resource. The new URI is not a substitute reference for the =
originally=20
requested resource. The 303 response MUST NOT be cached, but the =
response to the=20
second (redirected) request might be cacheable. </P>
<P>The different URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the =
response.=20
Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD =
contain a=20
short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s). </P><PRE>      =
Note: Many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 303
      status. When interoperability with such clients is a concern, the
      302 status code may be used instead, since most user agents react
      to a 302 response as described here for 303.
</PRE>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.3.5>10.3.5</A> 304 Not Modified</H3>
<P>If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is =
allowed,=20
but the document has not been modified, the server SHOULD respond with =
this=20
status code. The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus =
is=20
always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields. </P>
<P>The response MUST include the following header fields: </P><PRE>      =
- Date, unless its omission is required by section 14.18.1
</PRE>
<P>If a clockless origin server obeys these rules, and proxies and =
clients add=20
their own Date to any response received without one (as already =
specified by=20
[RFC 2068], section <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.19" =

rel=3Dxref>14.19</A>), caches will operate correctly. </P><PRE>      - =
ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent
        in a 200 response to the same request
</PRE><PRE>      - Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the =
field-value might
        differ from that sent in any previous response for the same
        variant
</PRE>
<P>If the conditional GET used a strong cache validator (see section =
13.3.3),=20
the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers. Otherwise (i.e., =
the=20
conditional GET used a weak validator), the response MUST NOT include =
other=20
entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached =
entity-bodies and=20
updated headers. </P>
<P>If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached, then the =
cache=20
MUST disregard the response and repeat the request without the =
conditional. </P>
<P>If a cache uses a received 304 response to update a cache entry, the =
cache=20
MUST update the entry to reflect any new field values given in the =
response.=20
</P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.3.6>10.3.6</A> 305 Use Proxy</H3>
<P>The requested resource MUST be accessed through the proxy given by =
the=20
Location field. The Location field gives the URI of the proxy. The =
recipient is=20
expected to repeat this single request via the proxy. 305 responses MUST =
only be=20
generated by origin servers. </P><PRE>      Note: RFC 2068 was not clear =
that 305 was intended to redirect a
      single request, and to be generated by origin servers only.  Not
      observing these limitations has significant security consequences.
</PRE>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.3.7>10.3.7</A> 306 (Unused)</H3>
<P>The 306 status code was used in a previous version of the =
specification, is=20
no longer used, and the code is reserved. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.3.8>10.3.8</A> 307 Temporary Redirect</H3>
<P>The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. =
Since the=20
redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to =
use the=20
Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if =
indicated by=20
a Cache-Control or Expires header field. </P>
<P>The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the =
response.=20
Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD =
contain a=20
short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s) , since many=20
pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 307 status. Therefore, =
the note=20
SHOULD contain the information necessary for a user to repeat the =
original=20
request on the new URI. </P>
<P>If the 307 status code is received in response to a request other =
than GET or=20
HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless =
it can=20
be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under =
which the=20
request was issued. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4>10.4</A> Client Error 4xx</H3>
<P>The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the =
client seems=20
to have erred. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server =
SHOULD=20
include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and =
whether=20
it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are =
applicable to=20
any request method. User agents SHOULD display any included entity to =
the user.=20
</P>
<P>If the client is sending data, a server implementation using TCP =
SHOULD be=20
careful to ensure that the client acknowledges receipt of the packet(s)=20
containing the response, before the server closes the input connection. =
If the=20
client continues sending data to the server after the close, the =
server's TCP=20
stack will send a reset packet to the client, which may erase the =
client's=20
unacknowledged input buffers before they can be read and interpreted by =
the HTTP=20
application. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.1>10.4.1</A> 400 Bad Request</H3>
<P>The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed =
syntax.=20
The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.2>10.4.2</A> 401 Unauthorized</H3>
<P>The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a =

WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.47) containing a challenge =
applicable=20
to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a =
suitable=20
Authorization header field (section <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.8"=20
rel=3Dxref>14.8</A>). If the request already included Authorization =
credentials,=20
then the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for =
those=20
credentials. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the =
prior=20
response, and the user agent has already attempted authentication at =
least once,=20
then the user SHOULD be presented the entity that was given in the =
response,=20
since that entity might include relevant diagnostic information. HTTP =
access=20
authentication is explained in "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest =
Access=20
Authentication" <A=20

<P>This code is reserved for future use. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.4>10.4.4</A> 403 Forbidden</H3>
<P>The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.=20
Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated. If =
the=20
request method was not HEAD and the server wishes to make public why the =
request=20
has not been fulfilled, it SHOULD describe the reason for the refusal in =
the=20
entity. If the server does not wish to make this information available =
to the=20
client, the status code 404 (Not Found) can be used instead. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.5>10.4.5</A> 404 Not Found</H3>
<P>The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No =
indication is=20
given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. The 410 (Gone) =
status=20
code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some internally =
configurable=20
mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no =
forwarding=20
address. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish =
to=20
reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other =
response is=20
applicable. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.6>10.4.6</A> 405 Method Not Allowed</H3>
<P>The method specified in the Request-Line is not allowed for the =
resource=20

containing a list of valid methods for the requested resource. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.7>10.4.7</A> 406 Not Acceptable</H3>
<P>The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating =
response=20
entities which have content characteristics not acceptable according to =
the=20
accept headers sent in the request. </P>
<P>Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity=20
containing a list of available entity characteristics and location(s) =
from which=20
the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity =
format is=20
specified by the media type given in the Content-Type header field. =
Depending=20
upon the format and the capabilities of the user agent, selection of the =
most=20
appropriate choice MAY be performed automatically. However, this =
specification=20
does not define any standard for such automatic selection. </P><PRE>     =
 Note: HTTP/1.1 servers are allowed to return responses which are
      not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the
      request. In some cases, this may even be preferable to sending a
      406 response. User agents are encouraged to inspect the headers of
      an incoming response to determine if it is acceptable.
</PRE>
<P>If the response could be unacceptable, a user agent SHOULD =
temporarily stop=20
receipt of more data and query the user for a decision on further =
actions. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.8>10.4.8</A> 407 Proxy Authentication Required</H3>
<P>This code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that the =
client=20
must first authenticate itself with the proxy. The proxy MUST return a=20
Proxy-Authenticate header field (section <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.33" =

rel=3Dxref>14.33</A>) containing a challenge applicable to the proxy for =
the=20
requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable=20
Proxy-Authorization header field (section <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.34" =

<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.9>10.4.9</A> 408 Request Timeout</H3>
<P>The client did not produce a request within the time that the server =
was=20
prepared to wait. The client MAY repeat the request without =
modifications at any=20
later time. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.10>10.4.10</A> 409 Conflict</H3>
<P>The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current =
state=20
of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations where it is =
expected=20
that the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the =
request.=20
The response body SHOULD include enough </P>
<P>information for the user to recognize the source of the conflict. =
Ideally,=20
the response entity would include enough information for the user or =
user agent=20
to fix the problem; however, that might not be possible and is not =
required.=20
</P>
<P>Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For =
example,=20
if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT included changes =
to a=20
resource which conflict with those made by an earlier (third-party) =
request, the=20
server might use the 409 response to indicate that it can't complete the =

request. In this case, the response entity would likely contain a list =
of the=20
differences between the two versions in a format defined by the response =

Content-Type. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.11>10.4.11</A> 410 Gone</H3>
<P>The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no =
forwarding=20
address is known. This condition is expected to be considered permanent. =
Clients=20
with link editing capabilities SHOULD delete references to the =
Request-URI after=20
user approval. If the server does not know, or has no facility to =
determine,=20
whether or not the condition is permanent, the status code 404 (Not =
Found)=20
SHOULD be used instead. This response is cacheable unless indicated =
otherwise.=20
</P>
<P>The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web =
maintenance=20
by notifying the recipient that the resource is intentionally =
unavailable and=20
that the server owners desire that remote links to that resource be =
removed.=20
Such an event is common for limited-time, promotional services and for =
resources=20
belonging to individuals no longer working at the server's site. It is =
not=20
necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as "gone" or to =
keep the=20
mark for any length of time -- that is left to the discretion of the =
server=20
owner. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.12>10.4.12</A> 411 Length Required</H3>
<P>The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content- =
Length.=20
The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid Content-Length =
header field=20
containing the length of the message-body in the request message. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.13>10.4.13</A> 412 Precondition Failed</H3>
<P>The precondition given in one or more of the request-header fields =
evaluated=20
to false when it was tested on the server. This response code allows the =
client=20
to place preconditions on the current resource metainformation (header =
field=20
data) and thus prevent the requested method from being applied to a =
resource=20
other than the one intended. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.14>10.4.14</A> 413 Request Entity Too Large</H3>
<P>The server is refusing to process a request because the request =
entity is=20
larger than the server is willing or able to process. The server MAY =
close the=20
connection to prevent the client from continuing the request. </P>
<P>If the condition is temporary, the server SHOULD include a Retry- =
After=20
header field to indicate that it is temporary and after what time the =
client MAY=20
try again. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.15>10.4.15</A> 414 Request-URI Too Long</H3>
<P>The server is refusing to service the request because the Request-URI =
is=20
longer than the server is willing to interpret. This rare condition is =
only=20
likely to occur when a client has improperly converted a POST request to =
a GET=20
request with long query information, when the client has descended into =
a URI=20
"black hole" of redirection (e.g., a redirected URI prefix that points =
to a=20
suffix of itself), or when the server is under attack by a client =
attempting to=20
exploit security holes present in some servers using fixed-length =
buffers for=20
reading or manipulating the Request-URI. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.16>10.4.16</A> 415 Unsupported Media Type</H3>
<P>The server is refusing to service the request because the entity of =
the=20
request is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the =
requested=20
method. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.17>10.4.17</A> 416 Requested Range Not =
Satisfiable</H3>
<P>A server SHOULD return a response with this status code if a request =
included=20
a Range request-header field (section 14.35), and none of the =
range-specifier=20
values in this field overlap the current extent of the selected =
resource, and=20
the request did not include an If-Range request-header field. (For =
byte-ranges,=20
this means that the first- byte-pos of all of the byte-range-spec values =
were=20
greater than the current length of the selected resource.) </P>
<P>When this status code is returned for a byte-range request, the =
response=20
SHOULD include a Content-Range entity-header field specifying the =
current length=20
of the selected resource (see section <A=20
href=3D"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.16" =

rel=3Dxref>14.16</A>). This response MUST NOT use the =
multipart/byteranges=20
content- type. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.4.18>10.4.18</A> 417 Expectation Failed</H3>
<P>The expectation given in an Expect request-header field (see section =
14.20)=20
could not be met by this server, or, if the server is a proxy, the =
server has=20
unambiguous evidence that the request could not be met by the next-hop =
server.=20
</P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.5>10.5</A> Server Error 5xx</H3>
<P>Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in =
which=20
the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the =
request.=20
Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD include an =
entity=20
containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a =
temporary=20
or permanent condition. User agents SHOULD display any included entity =
to the=20
user. These response codes are applicable to any request method. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.5.1>10.5.1</A> 500 Internal Server Error</H3>
<P>The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it =
from=20
fulfilling the request. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.5.2>10.5.2</A> 501 Not Implemented</H3>
<P>The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the =

request. This is the appropriate response when the server does not =
recognize the=20
request method and is not capable of supporting it for any resource. =
</P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.5.3>10.5.3</A> 502 Bad Gateway</H3>
<P>The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid =

from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the =
request. </P>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.5.4>10.5.4</A> 503 Service Unavailable</H3>
<P>The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a =
temporary=20
overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this =
is a=20
temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. If known, =
the=20
length of the delay MAY be indicated in a Retry-After header. If no =
Retry-After=20
is given, the client SHOULD handle the response as it would for a 500 =
response.=20
</P><PRE>      Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply =
that a
      server must use it when becoming overloaded. Some servers may wish
      to simply refuse the connection.
</PRE>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.5.5>10.5.5</A> 504 Gateway Timeout</H3>
<P>The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a =
timely=20
response from the upstream server specified by the URI (e.g. HTTP, FTP, =
LDAP) or=20
some other auxiliary server (e.g. DNS) it needed to access in attempting =
to=20
complete the request. </P><PRE>      Note: Note to implementors: some =
deployed proxies are known to
      return 400 or 500 when DNS lookups time out.
</PRE>
<H3><A id=3Dsec10.5.6>10.5.6</A> 505 HTTP Version Not Supported</H3>
<P>The server does not support, or refuses to support, the HTTP protocol =
